Carbon,   Utilization,  Capture , Storage \n Frame 4: 1.Capture \n Frame 5: CO2 from industry is captured and prevented from entering the atmosphere. \n Frame 6: This is done in power plants and other large-scale industries such as steel mills. \n Frame 7: CO2 is separated from other gases â€“ or even captured from the air using giant fans. \n Frame 8: 2. Utilization. \n Frame 9: After capture, CO2 can be reused â€“ to make fuel, cement, plastics... \n Frame 10: Or even as bubbles in fizzy drinks. \n Frame 11: 3. Storage. \n Frame 12: CO2 can also be injected deep into the ground into porous rock formations â€“ it fills the gaps. \n Frame 13: The same way oils and gases have been trapped underground for millennia. \n Frame 14: Carbon capture innovation can help us speed up on the road to net-zero."},

A video on research, opportunities and challenges.There have been a number of stories around nuclear fusion lately, with more predicted in the future. This would be a 60-second explainer video that we could reuse every time a new story broke (US spelling). Most interesting thing about fusion is how big the potential is in terms of energy output and how benign the waste issue is. Focus on this element rather than explaining how nuclear fusion works. Also mention how it's moved from government-backed research into start-ups, the private sector is getting involved. You can also use this article: ( https://www.ief.org/news/how-close-are-we-to-unlocking-the-limitless-energy-of-nuclear-fusion](https://www.ief.org/news/how-close-are-we-to-unlocking-the-limitless-energy-of-nuclear-fusion )  "},
